        <div class="critical-section">
            <h2>üîí Facial Recognition and Biometric Data Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> Our Application uses TWO TYPES of biometric authentication:</p>
            
            <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ DEVICE BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION (Face ID/Touch ID)</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> When you open the app, it uses your iPhone or iPad's built-in Face ID or Touch ID to verify you are the authorized device owner.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatic Authentication:</strong> Face ID/Touch ID triggers automatically when you launch the app</li>
                <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> Verifies you are the owner of the device before allowing app access</li>
                <li><strong>Apple-Managed:</strong> All Face ID/Touch ID data is processed and stored entirely by Apple in your device's Secure Enclave</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Our Access to Face ID/Touch ID Data:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ZERO Data Collection:</strong> We NEVER access, collect, or store your Face ID/Touch ID data</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication Result Only:</strong> We only receive a YES/NO result from Apple</li>
                <li><strong>No Transmission:</strong> Face ID/Touch ID data never leaves your device</li>
                <li><strong>Apple's Control:</strong> All biometric data is controlled entirely by iOS</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Purpose of Device Biometric Authentication:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Secure app entry and device ownership verification</li>
                <li>Compliance with Apple security requirements</li>
                <li>Fast and convenient authentication</li>
                <li>Prevention of unauthorized access to the app</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ CUSTOM FACE RECOGNITION (Attendance Verification)</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Separate facial scanning technology used to verify employee identity during attendance check-in and check-out.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Distinction:</strong> This is NOT used for app login - it's used ONLY for attendance verification after you're already logged in.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>What We Collect (Custom Face Recognition Only):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Facial Images:</strong> High-resolution photographs of your face taken during attendance registration</li>
                <li><strong>Biometric Templates:</strong> Mathematical representations of your facial features converted into encrypted data</li>
                <li><strong>Facial Landmarks:</strong> Unique facial geometry points (distance between eyes, nose shape, jawline, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Recognition Patterns:</strong> Digital signatures created from your facial characteristics</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication Attempts:</strong> Records of successful and failed attendance verification attempts</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>How Custom Facial Data is Processed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Registration:</strong> During first-time setup, the app captures multiple facial images from different angles</li>
                <li><strong>Template Creation:</strong> Your facial images are converted into encrypted biometric templates that cannot be reverse-engineered into photos</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Storage:</strong> Biometric templates are stored on Firebase Cloud Firestore (UAE region) with enterprise-grade encryption</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Matching:</strong> During attendance marking, your live facial scan is compared against your stored template</li>
                <li><strong>Liveness Detection:</strong> System verifies you are physically present (not a photo or video)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Purpose of Custom Face Recognition:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify employee identity during check-in/check-out</li>
                <li>Prevent attendance fraud (buddy punching)</li>
                <li>Ensure workplace security compliance</li>
                <li>Maintain accurate attendance records</li>
                <li><strong>NOT used for app login or account authentication</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Security Measures for Custom Facial Data:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>End-to-End AES-256 Encryption:</strong> All biometric data is encrypted during transmission and storage</li>
                <li><strong>Zero Image Storage:</strong> Original facial photographs are deleted immediately after template creation</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Biometric data is accessible only to authorized system administrators with audit trails</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Infrastructure:</strong> Data stored on Firebase Cloud Firestore (Google Cloud Platform - UAE region)</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Third-party security assessments and vulnerability testing</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate Deletion:</strong> Upon employment termination, all biometric data is permanently deleted within 30 days</li>
